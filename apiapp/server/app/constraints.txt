# Runtime constraints to keep scientific stack compatible with Python 3.11 and py-feat/nltools
# - numpy 2.x breaks many wheels compiled against 1.x; pin to <2
# - scipy >=1.11 removed scipy.stats.binom_test (required by nltools/py-feat); pin to <1.11
# - numexpr must be compatible with pinned NumPy
# - pandas 2.x may cause incompatibilities with older deps; pin to <2 for safety
